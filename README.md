# Information
[SimpleScore][GitHub] is a plugin for Minecraft servers that allows server owners to display various information to their players using the built-in Minecraft scoreboard system.

Supports selecting and showing specific scoreboards to players based on their permissions, certain conditions, current world or even the [WorldGuard][WorldGuard] region they are inside with a very simple and intuitive configuration system.

Also comes with support for both [PlaceholderAPI][PlaceholderAPI] and [MVdWPlaceholderAPI][MVdWPlaceholderAPI] allowing you to hook into thousands of other plugins to retreive and display their information in real time or create a set of conditions the player must meet to be able to see a certain scoreboard.

## Main Features
- A lag-free fully animated scoreboard with no flickering
- Fully supports RGB colors on 1.16 servers or newer
- Supports every major Minecraft version from 1.8.x to 1.20.x
- Can display scoreboards based on permissions, conditions, worlds and regions
- No character limit on 1.13 servers or newer (limited to 32 chars on older versions)*
- Fully compatible with [mcMMO][mcMMO] and other plugins that temporarly change the scoreboard*
- Every message sent by the plugin can be changed either by the built-in translation system or by providing a custom messages file

*This feature requires [ProtocolLib][ProtocolLib]. Adding [ProtocolLib][ProtocolLib] to your server will improve plugin compatibility and also reduce the number of packets sent to the players thus increasing server/client performance and reducing network bandwidth usage.
