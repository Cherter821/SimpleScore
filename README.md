# Information
[SimpleScore][GitHub] is a plugin for Minecraft servers that allows server owners to display various information to their players using Minecraft's built-in scoreboard system.

Supports selecting and showing specific scoreboards to players based on their permissions, certain conditions, the current world, or even the [WorldGuard][WorldGuard] region they are inside with a very simple and intuitive configuration system.

Also comes with support for [PlaceholderAPI][PlaceholderAPI], allowing you to hook into thousands of other plugins to retrieve and display their information in real time, or create a set of conditions that the player must meet to be able to see a particular scoreboard.

## Main Features
- A lag-free, fully animated scoreboard with no flickering
- Full RGB colour support on 1.16 servers or newer
- Supports all major Minecraft versions from 1.8.x to 1.20.x
- Can display scoreboards based on permissions, conditions, worlds and regions
- No character limit on 1.13 servers or newer (limited to 32 characters on older versions)
- Fully compatible with any other plugins that temporarily changes the scoreboard
- Any message sent by the plugin can be modified either by the built-in translation system or by providing a custom messages file
