/**
 * Represents a player that is capable of viewing a scoreboard and managing its visibility.
 * This interface serves as the core component for managing individual player's scoreboard state,
 * handling multiple scoreboard providers, and managing display priorities.
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Manages multiple scoreboards from different sources (plugins/services)
 * - Implements a priority system for scoreboard display
 * - Handles scoreboard visibility states
 * - Provides memory-safe player references
 *
 * Example usage:
 * ```kotlin
 * val viewer = Viewer(player)
 * val provider = Provider("MyPlugin", "game")
 *
 * // Set up a scoreboard with high priority
 * viewer.setScoreboard(gameScoreboard, provider, Priority.High)
 *
 * // Temporarily hide the scoreboard
 * viewer.hideScoreboard(provider)
 * ```
 *
 * @param V The type of the platform-specific player object.

     * This is particularly important in server environments where players can
     * disconnect at any time. Using WeakReference ensures that:
     * - Player objects can be properly garbage collected after disconnection
     * - Memory leaks are prevented even if viewer instances aren't explicitly cleaned up
     * - Server memory remains optimized during long-running sessions
